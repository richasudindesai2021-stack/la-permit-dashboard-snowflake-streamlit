# 🏙️ LA Building Permit Insights Dashboard

### *A Data Storytelling Project Using Snowflake Snowpark + Streamlit*

---

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes Los Angeles building permit data to uncover **where**, **how**, and **by whom** residential home improvements occur across the city.
Using **Snowflake Snowpark** for data processing and **Streamlit-in-Snowflake** for visualization, I built a fully interactive **multi-tab dashboard** that reveals deep patterns in:

* Luxury renovations (swimming pools 🏊)
* Interior upgrades (kitchens 🍳)
* Contractor dominance 🧰
* Income-based inequality 💰
* Citywide construction trends 📈

This dashboard and analysis were completed as part of a data storytelling assignment at USC Marshall.

## ⭐ Key Findings

### **1. Luxury home upgrades are concentrated in wealthy ZIP codes.**

Pools and high-valuation projects cluster in areas such as 90049, 90210, and 90272.

### **2. Kitchen renovations spiked after 2020.**

Average valuations and permit counts increased significantly during the post-COVID remodeling wave.

### **3. Renovation inequality is strongly tied to income.**

High-income tracts produce more permits than their share of households; lower-income areas lag behind.

### **4. A few contractors dominate the construction ecosystem.**

One contractor alone completed over 132,000 projects, demonstrating structural imbalance in renovation activity.

### **5. Citywide construction trends show long-term growth.**

Major permit types (additions, alterations, new builds) increased steadily with a COVID-era dip.
